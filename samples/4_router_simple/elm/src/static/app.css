/* 
 * This is an empty CSS file for use during development (when webpack-dev-server needs
 * something to serve up to avoid a 404). During development ("yarn dev"), the CSS is
 * dynamically compiled in as javacsript, for easy iteration.
 *
 * For a production build ("build_prod" script), a static elm.css file is generated
 * with all the CSS, and this is put in the svr/static directory instead of this. So
 * there is no performance penalty in production.
